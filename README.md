## To learn
- [ ] Flow flow exactly. 
- [ ] Flow kick => verify and sign =>
 send sign collection to Notary => Notary verification => Commit => Announce to the other participants.  
 
## Notarize
When two signs gather, notarize that some state was consumed.  
When double spent occurs, notary does't notarize sign collection. So, commitment fails.     

## Run commands deployNodes from terminal and application permission setting was necessary.
